# GRPC First LS Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity First
Every feature must start with the simplest possible implementation. 
YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles strictly enforced. 
Complexity must be justified with clear business value and documented rationale.

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement. 
Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. 
All code must have corresponding tests before implementation.

### III. Go Best Practices
Follow Go idioms and conventions. 
Use standard library when possible. 
Clear, readable code over clever solutions. 
Proper error handling required.

### IV. Documentation Standards
Code must be self-documenting with clear naming. 
README must include setup and run instructions. 
API documentation required for any public interfaces.

### V. Version Control Discipline
Atomic commits with clear messages. 
Feature branches for all development. 
No direct commits to main branch.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- Go fmt and go vet must pass
- No unused imports or variables
- Functions should be small and focused
- Error handling must be explicit

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Test coverage minimum 80%
- Tests must be fast and reliable

## Governance

All development must comply with these principles. 
Constitution violations require documented justification in complexity tracking. 
Amendments require team review and approval.
